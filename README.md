## Tagline
Mayo Clinic is a website that will be acting as a platform between doctors and patients making their communication easier.

# Detailed Explanation of the Idea
Amidst this pandemic, Patients face many difficulties such as going to hospitals as there is risk of getting infected by Covid-19 which is spreading very quickly. One of the most reoccuring problems are patients losing their prescriptions after a few days. We have come up with a solution named E- Prescription. 
E- Prescription allows patients to access their prescriptions anywhere without the fear of losing them. Paients are able to view their pulse in real time using our AI pulse Monitor. We also included features such as Video calling, a Chatting Platform for ease of communication with their doctor, a BMI Calculator, and a COVID-19 Tracker as well.
