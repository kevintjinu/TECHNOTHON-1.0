## Tagline
<!-- Mayo Clinic is a web application that helps patients connect with their doctors easily over the internet. We provide various methods of communicating with their doctors using login credentials. -->

# Detailed Explanation of the Idea
During this pandemic, patients find it hard to visit hospitals and communicate with their doctors with ease. This is where Dolo-650 comes into play. It acts as a platform between a doctor and their patients. This application was mainly made for the patients who are currently home quarantined due to covid or due to any other pre-existing conditions. We have included features such as Video calling, a Chatting Platform, E- Prescription, BMI Calculator, and a COVID-19 Tracker as well.

## Challenges we ran into
As this was actually our first hackathon, we ran into the problem of time management. We had a lot more planned for this project, such as AI pulse Rate Detector using Python Libraries and other features such as implementing graphs for the data generated over time. We ran into a bit of a problem while working with the firebase authentication which has since been resolved successfully. We believe we have a solid project on hand and we have done to the best of our abilities to get to this point. We hope you like our project.

## Future Updates
- We are planning to add a module for appointment booking
- We will be bringing a graphical representation of the BMI of a patient
- We will be implementing a diabetes tracker where the patient will keep a track of his diabetes level
- Indicating cancer with a  CT- Scan using AI and Machine learning
- Implementation of Eye Checking in the video call with doctor
